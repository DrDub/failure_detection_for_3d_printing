# Failure detection for 3D Printing

## Description
Failure detection module for 3D printing using Computer Vision.

## Methods
1. Image matching (comparing images from slicer and real printed object)
1. Object tracking (tracking print head to calculate real position, compared to theoretical position)
1. Spaghetti error detection (inspired from [TheSpaghettiDetective/TheSpaghettiDetective](https://github.com/TheSpaghettiDetective/TheSpaghettiDetective))
